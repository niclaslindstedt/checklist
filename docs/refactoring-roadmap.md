# Refactoring roadmap

The single source of truth for what this codebase considers a code smell
worth fixing. Worked via the `refactor` skill (`.agent/skills/refactor/`):
**Work mode** lands the highest-leverage pending item one PR at a time;
**Explore mode** surveys for new smells and appends them here without
touching code.

## Strategic context

The goal is to keep the codebase clean and the layering honest so new UI
surfaces, new storage backends, and new share / template features stay easy
to add. The dependency direction is `ui → domain`, `ui → storage`,
`storage → domain`; nothing in `src/domain/` may import from `ui/`,
`storage/`, `window`, `document`, or `fetch` (lint-enforced). The three
storage backends (LocalStorage, Google Drive, Dropbox) sit behind one
`StorageBackend` interface and must stay interchangeable — anything added to
one works for all, or is a capability the UI can feature-detect.

Non-test source files stay under the 1000-line cap (§20.5 of `OSS_SPEC.md`);
a file nearing it without an `oss-spec:allow-large-file:` opt-out is a
standing candidate to split by concern.

## Severity rubric

Fix threshold is **3**. Below 3 is cosmetic — don't add it.

| Band | What to look for |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| 9–10 | Architectural blocker. Correctness / persistence risk, a broken layering edge, or a `StorageBackend` divergence every backend bumps into. |
| 7–8  | Multiplier. Local today; every new storage backend / UI surface / share feature threads through it. |
| 5–6  | Friction. Slows iteration; readers stumble. Worth landing soon. |
| 3–4  | Nit with leverage. Cheap to fix; alternative call-sites would multiply if left alone. |
| 1–2  | Cosmetic. Don't add to the roadmap; if it ever bothers anyone enough, it'll re-surface. |

Refactor rules (full text in the skill): no behaviour changes, respect the
layering, aim for <500 lines of diff per PR, run `make lint && make test`,
and update this file in the same PR.
